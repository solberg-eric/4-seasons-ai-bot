# 4 Seasons of War (card game) - AI Bot
#### (Card game *description* and *instructions* viewable at https://www.4seasonsofwar.com/)

This project aims to create an intelligent computer player for the card game 4 Seasons of War. 4 Seasons is a pure strategy card game that has simplistic rules yet incorporates complex strategyâ€“similar to games like Chess or Go. Like most Chess computers, the 4 Seasons bot takes advantage of the minimax algorithm with alpha beta pruning. While the game is currently playable (in text form), the evaluation function is still evolving to increase the intelligence of the bot's playing decisions. As of now, I would consider the bot's intelligence level at "novice". Even so, I would be surprised if it could be beaten by a new opponent that has never played the game before.

Note: I created this project prior to becoming accustomed to standard Python style guides, so aspects of the code will look unorthodox and might not adhere to "best practice" principles.
