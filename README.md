# 4 Seasons of War (card game) - AI Bot
#### For card game RULES: https://www.4seasonsofwar.com/rules.html

This project aims to create an intelligent computer player for the card game '4 Seasons of War' (2-player version). 4 Seasons is a pure strategy card game that has simplistic rules yet incorporates complex strategyâ€“similar to games like Chess or Go...or computer programming for that matter. Like most Chess computers, the 4 Seasons bot takes advantage of the minimax algorithm, while also incorporating alpha beta pruning to reduce the time complexity of the algorithmic search. While the game is currently playable (in text form), the evaluation function is still in the process of evolving to increase the intelligence of the computer's playing decisions. As of now, I would consider the bot's level of intelligence at *novice*. Even so, I would be surprised if it was beaten by a new opponent that has never played the game before.
